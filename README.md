## üîç Key Insights & Analysis

### 1. **Sales Trends Over Time**
By analyzing the sales over time, we can identify peak sales periods, seasonal variations, and overall sales growth.

#### Example Visualization: Sales Trends Over Time
![Sales Trend](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Sales+Trend+Over+Time)  
*This line chart shows the sales growth over the months.*

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data/pizza_sales.csv')

# Convert OrderDate to datetime
df['OrderDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['OrderDate'])

# Group sales by Month
df['YearMonth'] = df['OrderDate'].dt.to_period('M')
monthly_sales = df.groupby('YearMonth')['Sales'].sum()

# Plotting Sales Trend
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
monthly_sales.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='tomato')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trend for Pizza Hut')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 2. **Top Selling Menu Items**
Understanding which menu items are the most popular allows for better inventory management and marketing decisions.

#### Example Visualization: Top Selling Menu Items
![Top Selling Pizza](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Top+Selling+Pizza)  
*Bar chart showing the top-selling pizzas at Pizza Hut.*

#### Example Code:
```python
top_items = df.groupby('MenuItem')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

# Plotting the top 10 selling menu items
top_items.plot(kind='barh', color='cornflowerblue', title='Top 10 Best-Selling Menu Items')
plt.xlabel('Total Sales ($)')
plt.ylabel('Menu Items')
plt.show()
```

### 3. **Regional Sales Distribution**
This analysis shows the performance of Pizza Hut across different regions, which is valuable for targeted promotions.

#### Example Visualization: Sales by Region
![Sales by Region](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Sales+by+Region)  
*Pie chart illustrating sales distribution across regions.*

#### Example Code:
```python
region_sales = df.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum()

# Plotting the regional sales distribution
region_sales.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', figsize=(8, 8), title="Sales Distribution by Region")
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()
```

### 4. **Promotional Effectiveness**
Analyzing the impact of promotions and discounts on sales can help optimize pricing strategies.

#### Example Visualization: Effect of Discounts on Sales
![Discount Impact](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Discount+Impact)  
*Bar chart comparing sales with and without discounts.*

#### Example Code:
```python
# Filter data for orders with discounts
discounted_sales = df[df['Discount'] > 0]

# Plotting sales comparison for discounted and non-discounted items
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sales_comparison = [df[df['Discount'] == 0]['Sales'].sum(), discounted_sales['Sales'].sum()]
plt.bar(['Non-Discounted', 'Discounted'], sales_comparison, color=['skyblue', 'orange'])
plt.title('Sales Comparison: Discounted vs Non-Discounted')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales ($)')
plt.show()
```
